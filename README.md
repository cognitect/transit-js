# transit-js

Transit is a data format and a set of libraries for conveying values between
applications written in different languages. This library provides support for
marshalling Transit data to/from JavaScript. transit-js will work with any
[ECMAScript-262 Edition
3](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST-ARCH/ECMA-262,%203rd%20edition,%20December%201999.pdf) 
or newer JavaScript implementation provided that a [JSON](http://www.json.org)
module that supplies `parse` and `stringify` methods is present. transit-js does
not currently support encoding to [MessagePack](http://msgpack.org). Unlike the
Java and Clojure implementations it relies on the non-streaming JSON parsing
mechanism of the host JavaScript environment.

This implementation's major.minor version number corresponds to the version of
the Transit specification it supports.

_NOTE: Transit is a work in progress and may evolve based on feedback.
As a result, while Transit is a great option for transferring data
between applications, it should not yet be used for storing data
durably over time. This recommendation will change when the
specification is complete._

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation can be found [here](http://cognitect.github.io/transit-js/classes/transit.html).

## Overview

transit-js supports the conveyance of semantically rich and extensible
data between heterogenous software systems whose components include
JavaScript servers and clients.

#### Beyond JSON

The [Transit rationale](http://blog.cognitect.com/blog/2014/7/22/transit) covers
many of the reasons to put aside the limitations of JSON. As with the other
Transit implementations, transit-js supports conveying a larger range of scalar
and non-scalar values than permitted by JSON. Of these types, the transit-js
handling of the map representation is the most novel from the perspective of a
JavaScript applications developer.

#### Transit Maps

Transit representations of maps are decoded by transit-js into a high
performance data structure that largely mirrors the [ECMAScript Edition
6](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:specification_drafts)
[Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) 
data type. Doing so allows natural indexing of data using common scalars like 64
bit integers and dates without requiring the out of band application logic often
encountered in systems that marshal JSON.

The adaptive implementation of transit-js maps delivers performance comparable
to plain JavaScript objects and native ES6 Map implementations.

## Usage

Please see the [Getting
Started](https://github.com/cognitect/transit-js/wiki/Getting-Started) page. For
an interactive guide check out the
[tour](http://cognitect.github.io/transit-tour).

From the browser transit-js is available at the top level:

```javascript
var t = transit;

function roundtrip(x) {
  var r = t.reader("json"),
      w = t.writer("json");
  return r.read(w.write(x));
}

function testRoundtrip() {
  var arr1 = ["red", "green", "blue"],
      arr2 = ["apple", "pear", "grape"],
      data = t.map();
  data.set(t.integer(1), arr1);
  data.set(t.integer(2), arr2);
  return t.equals(data, roundtrip(data));
}
```

From Node.js you must require transit-js (assuming you've
included it in your project dependencies):

```javascript
var t = require("transit-js");

function roundtrip(x) {
  var r = t.reader("json"),
      w = t.writer("json");
  return r.read(w.write(x));
}

function testRoundtrip() {
  var arr1 = ["red", "green", "blue"],
      arr2 = ["apple", "pear", "grape"],
      data = t.map();
  data.set(t.integer(1), arr1);
  data.set(t.integer(2), arr2);
  return t.equals(data, roundtrip(data));
}
```

## Contributing 

This library is open source, developed internally by Cognitect. We welcome
discussions of potential problems and enhancement suggestions on the
[transit-format mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/transit-format). Issues can be
filed using GitHub [issues](https://github.com/cognitect/transit-js/issues) for
this project. Because transit is incorporated into products and client projects,
we prefer to do development internally and are not accepting pull requests or
patches.

## Development

### Dependencies

Building and testing transit-js requires
[Node.js](http://nodejs.org). Install the project's additional
development dependencies with the following command from the repo
directory:

```
bin/deps
```

In order to build transit-js for
[ClojureScript](http://github.com/clojure/clojurescript),
[Maven](http://maven.apache.org) must be installed.

### Running the tests

```
bin/test
```

In order to run the `bin/verify` tests from
[transit-format](https://github.com/cognitect/transit-format), you must first
clone transit-format into the same parent directory as your transit-js checkout.
Then build the production Node.js build:

```
bin/build_release_node
```

### Build

#### Version

The build version is automatically incremented.  To determine the current build
version:

```
build/revision
```

#### Build for Node.js

```
bin/build_release_node
```

#### Build for Browser

```
bin/build_release_browser
```

#### Building the documentation

```
bin/docs
```

#### Build JAR for ClojureScript

Assuming you have a
[JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/downloads/java-ee-sdk-6u3-jdk-7u1-downloads-523391.html)
and [Maven](http://maven.apache.org) installed, the following will install a JAR
suitable for use from ClojureScript into your local Maven repository.

```
build/package_local
```
